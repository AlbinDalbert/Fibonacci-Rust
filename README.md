# Fibonacci-Rust

### To run the code
`imperative-fib`, `functional-fib` and `object-oriented-fib` are cargos, thus all that is needed is to navigate to the root directory of the cargo and run

`~/imperative-fib $ cargo run`

`~/imperative-fib $ cargo build`

`~/functional-fib $ cargo run`

`~/functional-fib $ cargo build`

`~/object-oriented-fib $ cargo run`

`~/object-oriented-fib $ cargo build`

### The Code

`length_mode()` and `range_mode()` are the two main functions this program cosists of. The other functions are for io and error handeling
